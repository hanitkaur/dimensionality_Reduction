# Dimensionality_Reduction
Dimenionality reduction for me is the process of simplifying complex data by reducing the number of features or variables while retaining the important information. If I simplyfy it more, I can say it is a means to look at same picture from different dimensions, and then select the dimension that gives the perfect view where all the data is there and can be easily identified.

Let me explain, this in more simpler terms, through a daily life example. Suppose you have a 1000 photographs and you want them to classify them and prepare different sets for each. You are classifying the photographs based on common themes or visual patterns. But there is another way in which you can group on the basis of categories or themes, making it easier to analyze and understand.

In a similar manner, dimensionality reduction techniques take a complex dataset with numerous features and transform it into a lower-dimensional representation. It simplifies the data, making it more manageable and allowing for better visualization, analysis, and decision-making.

In this notebook I am going to cover some techniques for dimensionality reduction with intution behind it:-

PCA
LDA
NMF
